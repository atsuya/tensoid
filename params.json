{"name":"Tensoid","body":"# tensoid: sendoid without flash\r\n\r\n`tensoid` is a technical attempt to do what [http://sendoid.com/](sendoid) does without flash.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Install\r\n\r\nClone this git repo and do `npm install`. The usual node stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\nAccess `tendoid` and drag and drop some file, and you'll get an URL. Tell this\r\nURL to someone you want to share the file with. Make sure you are still on the\r\npage when the someone opens the URL. That initiates a file transfer from your\r\nbrowser to the someone's browser in realtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Web Browsers\r\n\r\n`tensoid` works on Chrome and Firefox (6 and probably later). I'm using webkit-prefixed\r\nfunctions :p I'm planning to make it work with decent web browsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nTo run your own `tensoid`, just git clone this repository and run:\r\n\r\n    $ node app.js\r\n\r\nModify config.js to fit it to your environment.\r\n\r\nOr try running demo at [http://tensoid.pictshare.me](http://tensoid.pictshare.me).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nTechnically, `tensoid` does not do exactly how sendoid does its file transfer.\r\nSendoid uses flash and flash actually allows P2P communications among web\r\nbrowsers, but `tensoid` is sending a chunk to server and the server sends it to\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nOther thing is a name of file downloaded. At the moment, it tries to download\r\nwith some weird name without file extension. You should rename the name,\r\nespecially the file extension to use it with appropriate application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nSendoid for a procedure to initiate file transfer (set file, get url, and let\r\nreceiver access it).\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n`tensoid` is licensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Atsuya Takagi <atsuya.takagi@gmail.com> \r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
